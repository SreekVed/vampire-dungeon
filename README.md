# Dungeon Game

In this game, the player is in a dungeon full of vampires. The player has to destroy the vampires before his lamp runs out of battery. The player can see the vampires with a blinking of his lamp, after which the player has to move blindly before the following blinking. 

The dimensions of the dungeon, the number of vampires, the charge of the headlight and whether the vampires move every turn are all configurable. By default, the dungeon is 10x10, there are 5 vampires, 5 moves, and the vampires change positions every turn.

The dungeon, player and vampires are shown in text form. The first line in the print output shows the remaining number of moves (lamp battery). Next, the coordinates of all characters on the map are presented, with the player represented by "@" and the vampires represented by a "v".


Once the game map is printed, the player can make a move. The player is controlled by using the WSAD keys. With one move, the player can walk any number of steps.

If all the vampires are killed before the lamp battery runs out, the player wins and the game ends.
